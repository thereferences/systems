# Data & Datasheets

<br>

The datasheet of a dataset outlines the data set's provenance, lineage, and a bit more.  Each dataset must have its own datasheet.  Gebru & colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010v1.pdf" target="_blank">first proposed Datasheets for Datasets</a>, for machine learning products or projects, during the years 2018/2019.  Following feedback from a variety of institutions, industries, agencies, etc., a baseline Datasheets for Datasets outline was released.[^acm]<sup>, </sup>[^arXiv]  Each datasheet consists of a set of questions, and the datasheet's primary objective vis-à-vis data set creator is to:

> … encourage data set creators to reflect carefully upon (a) the "process of creating, distributing, and maintaining a dataset", and (b) "any underlying assumptions, potential risks or harms, and implications of use“

The primary objective vis-à-vis data set user is to:

> … ensure that the data set user has the information required  to  "… make informed decisions about using a dataset."

This chapter consists of a set of sections.  The sections, except the Natural Language Processing section, reflect the groupings of the questions in the latest datasheet version. [^acm]<sup>, </sup>[^arXiv]<sup>, </sup>[^applicability]  The questions of the natural language processing (NLP) section apply to NLP projects only.  The questions were developed by Bender & Friedman. [^bender]
