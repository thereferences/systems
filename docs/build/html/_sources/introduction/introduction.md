> An illustration of considerations vis-Ã -vis a potential business machine learning project.  The project details inform the feasibility assessment.

<br>
<br>

The aim of these pages is to ensure that each prospective client/collaborator carefully considers the time commitment, collaboration commitment, cost, range of expertise, project details, etc., that are required for a business machine learning project. 

<br>

A project's details are especially critical to conducting a well-informed technical feasibility & economic 
viability assessment before proceeding.  It is also important to beware that the data science aspect of the project is only a part of the project, ignoring this leads to [project failures](https://www.kdnuggets.com/survey-machine-learning-projects-still-routinely-fail-to-deploy) due to, e.g.,

* Under-planning.
* Ambiguous project scope/design details. 
* Project pilots that are neither informed by **nor** tests the deployment goal.
* Underestimating, or ignoring, cost.
* Ignoring the critical importance of intensive collaboration between the business, data science, operations, etc., teams.

<br>
<br>

One of the first sections of these pages is **Deployment Goal**.  Colleagues may question why.  Here are a few references that 
capture our experience of why business data science projects fail, and the advantages of starting with ``the end in mind'' [^deployment]

* [Why Data Science Projects Fail](https://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/LYTX.2023.02.04/full/): Practical Principles for Data Science Success, by Douglas A. Gray.  This is the first article of the excellent [series](https://pubsonline.informs.org/action/doSearch?&target=digital-object-search&content=digitalObjects&Keywords=Principles%20for%20Successful%20Analytics%20Projects).
