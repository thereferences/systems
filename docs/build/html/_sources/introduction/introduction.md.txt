# Introduction


## Background

**These pages** complement an in-development online *project details hub*.  The hub's focus is business machine learning
projects, and its aim is the simplification of requirements elicitation; it has sets of questions pertinent to machine
learning dependent projects.  An external partner is developing the online hub, which will be a component of the Scottish
Artificial Intelligence Register platform. [^business]

In future, we hope the *project details hub* will reduce the likelihood that a project will fail, i.e., will aid
successful deployments of machine learning solutions within

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Applications that directly or indirectly serve the public.</li>
    <li class="disc">Back-end operations or internal applications.</li>
    <li class="disc">Policy teams, vis-Ã -vis providing evidence/insights based on the automatic and continuous executions of simple and complex models.</li>
</ul>

<br>

These pages are not as comprehensive as the hub.  The objective: share a few help notes with colleagues whilst we await 
the hub's first release.  However, because these pages might be a helpful reference point, we will continuously update its content.

<br>
<br>

## Purpose

These pages complement the upcoming *project details hub* by explaining selections of the questions therein.  Together, 
the expectation is that prospective clients/collaborators will **(a)** have well detailed project requirements, **(b)** carefully consider the time commitment, collaboration commitment, cost, range of expertise, project details, etc., that are required for machine learning dependent projects.  Additionally, stakeholders will be able to make well informed decisions about whether to proceed with a project.

<br>

A project's details are especially critical to conducting a well-informed technical feasibility & economic 
viability assessment before proceeding.  It is also important to beware that the data science aspect of the project is only a part of the project, ignoring this leads to [project failures](https://www.kdnuggets.com/survey-machine-learning-projects-still-routinely-fail-to-deploy) due to, e.g.,

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Under-planning.</li>
    <li class="disc">Ambiguous project scope/design details.</li>
    <li class="disc">Project pilots that are neither informed by <b>nor</b> tests the deployment goal.</li>
    <li class="disc">Underestimating, or ignoring, cost.</li>
    <li class="disc">Ignoring the critical importance of intensive collaboration between the business, data science, operations, etc.,
teams.</li>
</ul>

<br>

One of the first sections of these pages is **Deployment Goal**.  Colleagues may question why.  Here are a few references that 
capture our experience of why business data science projects fail, and the advantages of starting with ``the end in mind'' [^deployment]
