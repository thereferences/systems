A later version of this hub will have more details, and an example.  In brief, business performance metrics may focus on, e.g.,

* Financial savings, return on investment, due time saving, error reduction, etc.
* The cost of mistakes over time, e.g., misdiagnosis over time. 

Considering the retinal images classification example.  The client may use the relationship between diabetic retinopathy severity, and the life-time cost of  sight loss prevention/sight loss delay, to define a set of business metrics for model evaluation.
