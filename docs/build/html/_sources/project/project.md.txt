# Critical Preliminaries

## Problem Statement

What is the problem, and why is it important to solve this problem?

<br>

## Outcome Expectations

What are the potential product's outcome expectations, e.g.,

<blockquote>
    An increase in the detection of early-stage, i.e. mild, diabetic retinopathy, hence the prevention of sight loss amongst a greater percentage of diabetic patients.
</blockquote>

<br>

The underlying aim might be, e.g.,

<blockquote>
    To reduce the mis-classification rate of retinal images of diabetic patients to ≤ 1.25% per class per quarter.
</blockquote>

<br>

## Deployment Goal

**What is the aim, expected output, of the product's model?**  Example:

<blockquote>
    A retinal image's diabetic retinopathy classification probability per class.
</blockquote>

<br>

**What will the deployed product present to the optician?**  **Or** rather, **how will the model's output be used?**  Considering the example above, the client's opticians might expect: [^deployment]

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">The classification probability per class.</li>
    <li class="disc">The definition of each class.</li>
    <li class="disc">The classification; vis-à-vis the highest classification probability.</li>
    <li class="disc">The preliminary treatment pathway of the classification, according to the rules of the optician's institution.</li>
    <li class="disc">The retinal image.</li>
</ul>

[^deployment]: This is not machine learning.  This is about integrating a machine learning model's output into a business product, and hence business operations.
