# Motivation

The motivation, or deliberations, that led to the collection and storage of a data set can impact its appropriateness 
for model development.  For example, the outcome of a deliberation might have been to:

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Focus on, collect, and store, the data of a particular strata of a population.</li>
    <li class="disc">Retain aggregated records only.</li>
</ul>

The former will limit the applicability of any models that depend on the data set, using the latter is ill-advised due to lost information and ecological fallacy risks.  Additionally, it is important to beware of funding/sponsorship bias.[^external-validity]<sup>, </sup>[^industry-sponsorship-bias]<sup>, </sup>[^sponsorship-bias]

Hence

<ol class="numeric">
    <li class="numeric">Why was the data set created?
        <ul class="disc">
            <li class="disc">Was there a specific task in mind?</li>
            <li class="disc">Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="numeric">Who created the data set?
        <ul class="disc">
            <li class="disc">In brief, which team, organisation, research group, etc., created the dataset?  Was it created for another entity?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="numeric">Who funded the creation of the dataset?</li>
</ol>
