# Usability & Accessibility

The foci herein are the requirements/constraints vis-Ã -vis

* Interface: The constraints herein depend on $(a)$ the audience, e.g., children, young adults, executives, $(b)$ the organisation's presentation or branding norms, $(c)$ and more.[^volere]
* Style: The audience, e.g., children, young adults, executives, dictates the constraints herein.[^volere]
* Ease of use: Each ease of use constraint must have fit criteria for acceptance testing.[^volere]
* Learnability: Again, each constraint must have fit criteria for acceptance testing.[^volere]
* Accessibility: For more details study the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)[^accessibility]

The client team should have an unambiguous outline per requirement/constraint.
