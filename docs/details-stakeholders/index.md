# Stakeholders

Identify and record all the project's stakeholders.

<br>

## Who?

The stakeholders are the people who (<a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/kader/Robertson.pdf" target="_blank">Volere</a>)

<blockquote>
    … can affect the outcome/success of a project and, or, are affected by its outcome/success.
</blockquote>

Examples include:

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc"><b>The client.</b>  The entity <b>(a)</b> the system/product is being built for, and <b>(b)</b> that will pay for the system/product.</li>
    <li class="disc"><b>The signatories.</b>  The people who need to sign-off aspects of the project, e.g., system security, data access, etc.</li>
    <li class="disc"><b>The end users.</b>  The people who will interact with the product.</li>
</ul>

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) hosts a detailed discussion of [stakeholder management](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap21.html).  The discussion includes a [sample stakeholder map for an imaginary project](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap21.html#:~:text=21.3.1.1-,Sample%20Stakeholder%20Analysis,-A%20sample%20stakeholder).  It is a good guide to discerning a project's stakeholders and their import.[^TOGAF]<sup>,</sup>[^stake]

## Register

Create a stakeholder register.  The stakeholder register is a

>… project document that includes information about project stakeholders including an assessment and classification of project stakeholders.[^guide]

The details per stakeholder should include:[^stake]

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Name</li>
    <li class="disc">Role in employing organisation.</li>
    <li class="disc">The stakeholder's employing organisation department.</li>
    <li class="disc">Role in project.</li>
    <li class="disc">And, any other items pertinent to constructive stakeholder interactions.</li>
</ul>
