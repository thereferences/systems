The [systems engineering body of knowledge](https://sebokwiki.rg/wiki/Guide_to_the_Systems_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge_(SEBoK)) notes that reliability, maintenance, and availability attributes are three of the core attributes that affect the [utility of a system and its economic life-cycle cost](https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/System_Reliability,_Availability,_and_Maintainability).  In the context of machine learning products, reliability, maintenance, availability, and resilience specifications are critical to items such as

* continuous service,

* drift monitoring & continuous model performance improvement

and the costs thereof.  The tasks herein will require the aid of a reliability engineer, or similar.  The aim being to

* Define the reliability, maintenance, availability, and resilience expectations via metrics constraints.

* Outline in-built designs/solutions that minimise the probability of constraints breaches.
