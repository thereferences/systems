# Data & Datasheets

<br>

The datasheet of a dataset outlines the dataset's provenance.  Each dataset must have its own datasheet.  Gebru & colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010v1.pdf" target="_blank">first proposed Datasheets for Datasets</a>, for machine learning products or projects, during the years 2018/2019.  Following feedback from a variety of institutions, industries, agencies, etc., a baseline Datasheets for Datasets outline was released. [1, 2]

Each datasheet consists of a set of questions, and the datasheet's primary objective vis-à-vis dataset creator is to:

> … encourage dataset creators to reflect carefully upon (a) the "process of creating, distributing, and maintaining a dataset", and (b) "any underlying assumptions, potential risks or harms, and implications of use“

The primary objective vis-à-vis dataset user is to

> … ensure that the dataset user has the information required  to  "… make informed decisions about using a dataset."

This chapter consists of a set of sections.  The sections, except the Natural Language Processing section, reflect the 
groupings of the questions in the latest datasheet version.[^applicability]  The questions of the natural language 
processing (NLP) section apply to NLP projects only.  The questions were developed by Bender & Friedman. [1, 2, 3]
