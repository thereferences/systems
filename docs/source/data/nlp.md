# Natural Language Processing

This section only applies to data sets for natural language processing.  The sections reflect the _proposed data statements_ of <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.162/tacl_a_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing" target="_blank">Data Statements for Natural Language Processing: Toward Mitigating System Bias and Enabling Better Science</a> by E Bender & B Friedman.  Please study the description of each statement; [Section 5](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.162/tacl_a_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing), brief excerpts below.[^pertinent]


<br>


## Curation Rationale

"… what were the goals in selecting texts, both in the original collection and in any further sub-selection?"</td></tr>


<br>


## Language Variety

Languages "… differ from each other in structural ways that can interact with NLP algorithms.  Within a language, regional or social dialects can also show great variation …"

<br>


## Speaker Demographic 
_Ditto_


<br>


## Annotator Demographic

``What are the demographic characteristics of the annotators and annotation guideline developers? Their own “social address” influences their experience with language and thus their perception of what they are annotating''


<br>


## Speech Situation

"… characteristics of the speech situation can affect linguistic structure and patterns at many levels"

<br>

## Text Characteristics [^text]

"… genre and topic influence the vocabulary and structural characteristics of texts"

<br>

## Recording Quality

_Ditto_

<br>

## Provenance Appendix
"For datasets built out of existing datasets, the data statements for the source datasets should be included as an appendix"
