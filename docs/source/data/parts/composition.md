In general, the questions herein should be studied before data collection.  The datasheets paper [1] notes that most of the questions:

> "… are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about using 
> the dataset for their chosen tasks. … the questions are designed to elicit information about compliance with the EU's > General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions."

## What does each data set instance represent?

Describe what each instance, i.e., row, of the data set represents.  Although peculiar, if the data set is 
multi-representational, e.g., an instance in a merchant's data base table might represent one of:

* an online reading event
* an online product purchasing event
* an online download event

Each representation must be described.

<br>

## The # of Instances

How many instances does the data set have?

<br>

## Is the data set a sample of a larger data set?

**IF YES:**

* If the data set **is representative** of the larger data set: How was representativeness verified/validated? OR
* If the data set **is not representative** of the larger data set, e.g., is a geographically focused subset, explain why.
