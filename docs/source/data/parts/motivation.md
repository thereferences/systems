# Motivation

<br>

The motivation, or deliberations, that led to the collection and storage of a data set can impact its appropriateness 
for model development.  For example, the outcome of a deliberation might have been to:

* Focus on, collect, and store, the data of a particular strata of a population.
* Retain aggregated records only.

The former will limit the applicability of any models that depend on the data set, using the latter is ill-advised due to lost information and ecological fallacy risks.  Additionally, it is important to beware of funding/sponsorship bias.

Hence

<ol>
    <li>Why was the data set created?
        <ul><li>Was there a specific task in mind?</li>
        <li>Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Who created the data set?
        <ul><li>In brief, which team, organisation, research group, etc., created the dataset, and on behalf of which entity, e.g., company, institution, organisation, etc., was it created?</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Who funded the creation of the dataset?</li>
</ol>
