# Natural Language Processing

This section only applies to data sets for natural language processing.

The list of details of interest reflect the _proposed data statements_ of <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.162/tacl_a_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing" target="_blank">Data Statements for Natural Language Processing: Toward Mitigating System Bias and Enabling Better Science</a>, by E Bender & B Friedman, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.  Please study the description of each statement; [Section 5](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.162/tacl_a_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing), brief excerpts below.[^pertinent]

    <tr><td>Annotator Demographic</td><td>``What are the demographic characteristics of the annotators and annotation guideline developers? Their own “social address” influences their experience with language and thus their perception of what they are annotating''</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Speech Situation</td><td>"… characteristics of the speech situation can affect linguistic structure and patterns at many levels"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Text Characteristics</td><td>"… genre and topic influence the vocabulary and structural characteristics of texts"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Recording Quality</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Provenance Appendix</td><td>"For datasets built out of existing datasets, the data statements for the source datasets should be included as an appendix"</td></tr>
