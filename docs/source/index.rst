Business Machine Learning Projects
==================================


**These pages** complement an in-development online *project details capture hub*.  The hub's focus is business machine learning projects, and its aim is the simplification of requirements elicitation; it has sets of questions pertinent to machine learning dependent projects.  An external partner is developing the online hub, which will be a component of the Scottish Artificial Intelligence Register platform.

The word *business* indicates that the focus is not research.

In future, we hope the *project details capture hub* will reduce the likelihood that a project will fail; will aid
successful deployments of machine learning dependent solutions within

* Public serving applications.
* Back-end operations or internal applications.
* Policy teams, in terms of providing evidence/insights based on the automatic and continuous executions of simple and complex models.

**These pages** are not as comprehensive as the hub.  The objective - share a few help notes with colleagues whilst we await the hub's first release.  However, because these pages might be a helpful reference point, we will continuously update its content.
