The aim of these pages is to ensure that every team carefully considers the commitment (time & collaboration), cost, 
range of expertise, etc., that is required for a business machine learning project.  To ensure that it is possible to 
conduct a well-informed technical feasbility & economic viability assessment before proceeding.  To beware that the data 
science aspect of the project is only a part of the project.

* Business machine learning projects & failure
  * Underestimating planning requirements.
  * Underestimating, or ignoring, cost.
  * Project Misunderstanding: It is not a data project, it is not a technology project, it is a business project.
  * Ignoring the critical importance of intensive collaboration between business, data science, operations, etc., teams.
* United Kingdom & Data Scientist Turnover
