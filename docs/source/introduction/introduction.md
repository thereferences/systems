solutions development team; it develops machine learning dependent solutions.

The aim of these pages is to ensure that each prospective client/collaborator carefully considers the commitment 
(time & collaboration), cost, range of expertise, project details, etc., that are required for a business machine learning 
project. 

A project's details are especially critical to conducting a well-informed technical feasibility & economic 
viability assessment before proceeding.  It is also important to beware that the data science aspect of the project is 
only a part of the project, ignoring this leads to [project failures](https://www.kdnuggets.com/survey-machine-learning-projects-still-routinely-fail-to-deploy):

> Business machine learning projects failures, a few examples of causes:
> * Under-planning.
> * Project Misunderstandings & Opaqueness: It is not a data project, it is not a technology project, it is a business project.  The business' deployment goal, and the underlying model's business performance metrics, must be unambiguously detailed.
> * Underestimating, or ignoring, cost.
> * Ignoring the critical importance of intensive collaboration between the business, data science, operations, etc., teams.

<br>

Finally, understanding what data science is, and is not, understanding the demands of a business machine learning project,
etc., is a step towards avoiding [data scientists turnover](https://www.consortia.com/insights/why-do-data-scientists-leave-their-jobs/bp120/) problems, and more.
