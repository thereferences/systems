## Aim

What is the machine learning model's objective?  Example:

> To determine the probability that a retinal image is a member of a diabetic retinopathy class; the classes are no 
> (diabetic retinopathy), mild, moderate, severe, proliferative.

$\sum\limits_{l = 1} p(\mathcal{C}_{l}) = 1$, &nsbp; l = {no, mild, moderate, severe, proliferative}
 
Note, the model's objective matches the deployed product's model output expectations [Deployment Goal Link].
