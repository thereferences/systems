# Aim

<br>

What is the machine learning model's aim?  For example:

> To determine the probability that a retinal image is a member of a diabetic retinopathy class; the classes are _no_ 
> (diabetic retinopathy), _mild_, _moderate_, _severe_, _proliferative_.

> $\sum\limits_{l = 1} p(\mathcal{C}_{l}) = 1$,  $\qquad l =$ {no, mild, moderate, severe, proliferative}
 
**Note**, the model's aim matches the deployed product's <a href="../project/project.html#deployment-goal">model output 
expectations</a>.
