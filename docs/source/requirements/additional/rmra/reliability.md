# Reliability

<br>

In the systems engineering body of knowledge the [basic definition of reliability](https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/System_Reliability,_Availability,_and_Maintainability#Reliability) is

> “ … the probability of a product performing its intended function under stated conditions without failure for a given time period”.

In the context of machine learning systems, the reliability specification of each intended function, i.e., each functional requirement, must detail/specify the

* Function in question, and its operating environment.
* Time scales; for evaluating the reliability metrics.
* Definition of failure; for evaluating the reliability metrics, and for in-built failure mitigation considerations.
* [Reliability metrics](https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/System_Reliability,_Availability,_and_Maintainability#Metrics).

This aids (a) the design of possible in-built solutions that mitigate factors that affect reliability, and (b) system monitoring strategy, and the operations thereof.  Study the [reliability, maintainability, and availability page](https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/System_Reliability,_Availability,_and_Maintainability) of the systems engineering body of knowledge for the expectations herein.
