# Context & Architecture

Additionally, include data flow diagrams.

## System Context Diagram

The system context diagram illustrates how the service node of the system interacts with the world it is serving; a 
[slightly complex example](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.14.x/architecture.html#level-1-context).

<br>

## Architecture

The architecture, which outlines integrations with other systems, modelling stages, data flows, monitoring node, 
re-training node, etc.
