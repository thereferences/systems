# Functional Requirements

<br>

A **functional requirement** specifies what a deployed product/system must do.

**Note, (a)** a system may have more than one requirement, and **(b)** each requirement must have at least one criterion.  The [Volere Specification](https://homepages.laas.fr/kader/Robertson.pdf) defines a criterion, i.e., fit criterion, as an objective measure

> "â€¦ for defining the meaning of a requirement, and eventually testing whether a given solution satisfies the original requirement." ([Volere Specification](https://homepages.laas.fr/kader/Robertson.pdf))

The _deployment goal_ dictates what the product/system will be, and the functional requirements thereof.
