# Reliability, Maintainability, Resilience, Availability

The [systems engineering body of knowledge](https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Guide_to_the_Systems_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge_(SEBoK)) notes that reliability, maintenance, and availability attributes are three of the core attributes that affect the [utility of a system and its economic life-cycle cost](https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/System_Reliability,_Availability,_and_Maintainability).  In the context of machine learning products, reliability, maintenance, availability, and resilience specifications are critical to items such as

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">continuous service,</li>
    <li class="disc">drift monitoring & continuous model performance improvement</li>
</ul>

and the costs thereof.  The tasks herein will require the aid of a reliability engineer, or similar.  The aim being to

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Define the reliability, maintenance, availability, and resilience expectations via metrics constraints.</li>
    <li class="disc">Outline in-built designs/solutions that minimise the probability of constraints breaches.</li>
</ul>
