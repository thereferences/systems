**Aim**

Identify and record all the project's stakeholders.

<br>

**Notes**

The stakeholders are the people who

… can affect the outcome/success of _a_ project and/or _are_ affected by its outcome/success.  ([Volere](https://homepages.laas.fr/kader/Robertson.pdf))

Examples include:

* **The client.**  The entity **(a)** the system/product is being built for, and **(b)** that will pay for the system/product.
* **The signatories.**  The people who need to sign-off aspects of the project, e.g., system security, data access, etc.
* **The end users.**  The people who will interact with the product.

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) hosts a detailed discussion of [stakeholder management](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap21.html).  The discussion includes a [sample stakeholder map for an imaginary project](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap21.html#:~:text=21.3.1.1-,Sample%20Stakeholder%20Analysis,-A%20sample%20stakeholder).  It is a good guide to discerning a project's stakeholders and their import.
