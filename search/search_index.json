The underlying aim might be, e.g.,                                  To reduce the mis-classification rate of retinal images of diabetic patients to \u2264 1.25% per class per quarter.          Deployment Goal What is the aim, expected output, of the product's model?  Example:                      A retinal image's diabetic retinopathy classification probability per class.
